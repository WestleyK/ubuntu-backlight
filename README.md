## Install, Update, and Uninstall:


### Install the binary:

Copy-paste this in your terminal:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WestleyK/ubuntu-backlight/master/easy-install.sh | sh

### Should you install the pre-compiled code?

**Why to install the pre-compiled code:**
 - No dependency needed to install.
 - You don't need golang to compile the source code.

**Why not to install the pre-compiled code:**
 - It may not be fully compatible (i.e., it could be only partially compatible).
